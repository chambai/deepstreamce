LoggingEnabled				#bool			# Boolean indicating if console output is to be logged to a file
LogLevel				#INFO,DEBUG		# The types of messages that are logged. INFO or DEBUG.
ProcessorType				#CPU,GPU		# The processor type that the code is run on. CPU or GPU
DatasetName                         # Dataset name
DataFilter				#2classes,5classes		# Limits the activation training data to instances containing the first n classes only
DataClasses			# A comma-separated list of classes that the DNN is trained on
DnnModelPath							# Path and name of the trained h5 DNN model.  This can be specified as an absolute path or a relative path to the deepactistream folder 
mcod_k					#int			# The nominated number of neighbours for MCOD clustering
mcod_radius				#float			# The distance parameter for outlier detection for MCOD clustering
mcod_windowsize				#int			# The window size parameter for MCOD clustering
IncludedLayers			# A comma-separated list of layers of the DNN that are to be included in the activation extraction
NumActivationTrainingInstances		#int			# Integer defining the number of training instances used for getting activation data. If set to -1, all instances in the training data will be used
ActivationTrainingBatchSize		#int			# Integer defining the number of training instances that activation data will be extracted for in one batch (this is required due to python/IDE memory limitations)
NumUnseenInstances			#int			# Integer defining the total number of unseen instances to be processed individually. This is used in conjunction with DataDiscrepancy and DataDiscrepancyFrequency to provide the specified frequency of data discrepancies defined there
DataDiscrepancyFrequency					# The frequency of the data discrepancy i.e. '250in500' will be 250 instances with a data discrepancy (concept evolution) and 250 instances of a known class from the test data.
DataDiscrepancyClass	#int				# The class number of the concept evolution class
